### September 2022

The Goal of this case study is to use the data provided by the company to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

The business task includes :
1. A clear statement of the business task
2. A description of all data sources used
3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
4. A summary of the analysis
5. Supporting visualizations and key findings
6. Top three recommendations based on the analysis

All the data cleaning and manipulation process are done in R (Kaggle) and then analyzed and visualized in Tableau.
